# Red Wine Quality Prediction with Logistic Regression and PyQT5 GUI

## Overview
Welcome to the Red Wine Quality Prediction project! This Python-based application utilizes a machine learning algorithm, specifically logistic regression, to predict the quality of red wine based on various features. The project also integrates a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using PyQT5, allowing users to interact with the prediction model effortlessly.

## Features
Logistic Regression Model: A robust machine learning model is employed to analyze and predict the quality of red wine based on factors such as acidity, pH levels, and alcohol content.

PyQT5 GUI: The application features an intuitive and visually appealing GUI built with PyQT5, providing a seamless experience for users to input wine characteristics and receive quality predictions.

Interactive Prediction: Users can input wine features through the GUI, triggering real-time predictions and obtaining quality scores with ease.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The project includes detailed exploration and preprocessing steps for the red wine dataset to enhance the model's accuracy.

## Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn (for logistic regression)
PyQT5 (for GUI development)
